How to run the tell-phone-number program.
July 6, 2016


The program runs either silently with a keyboard, or through a microphone and speaker.


1. Download the git project, 
   https://github.com/saund/tell-phone-number, to a directory, e.g.
   C:\git-projects\dialogue\tell-phone-number

2. Make sure you have python 2.7 installed on your computer.

3. Install needed packages.  From a terminal window:

On Windows
> pip install gtts
> pip install pyaudio


On Mac
> sudo pip install gtts

You may have to install MacPorts on your mac in order to do this next step.

> sudo port install portaudio

> sudo pip install --global-option='build_ext' --global-option='-I/opt/local/include' --global-option='-L/opt/local/lib' pyaudio





4. cd to tell-phone-number/python

5. > python

6. 
>>> import dialogAgent as da

7. To run silently in keyboard mode:

>>> da.loopDialog(True)

   To run with a microphone and speaker:

>>> da.loopDialog()

Note: The ASR and TTS are done by a google service.  This is very good but not
perfect.  Try to speak clearly and not too fast.   Double check the ASR by looking 
at the screen printout.   The system cannot listen at the same time it is speaking.  
You may have to give a split-second for the program to start listening to your speech 
again after it speaks.


The program prints out a lot of debugging and diagnosis output to the screen.

8. In keyboard mode, read the program's output as "gen:..."

example:

gen: Would you like to send or receive a phone number?


9. Right now, the program is capable only of sending a telephone number to the user.
You can start by typing or saying,
"Tell me the telephone number"


10. To quit the program, 
-type "quit" at the keyboard

>>> quit

or if in mic/speaker mode,
-say "stop processing"
     "stop computer"
     "stop listening"
     "stop now"

To exit python, type
quit()


When you quit the running program, a transcript file, "transcript-da.text", is written to your home directory.
