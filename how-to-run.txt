How to run the tell-phone-number program.
July 6, 2016


The program runs either silently with a keyboard, or through a microphone and speaker.


1. Download the git project, 
   https://github.com/saund/tell-phone-number, to a directory, e.g.
   C:\git-projects\dialogue\tell-phone-number

2. Make sure you have python 2.7 installed on your computer.

3. cd to tell-phone-number/python

4. > python

5. 
>>> import dialogAgent as da

6. To run silently in keyboard mode:

>>> da.loopDialog(True)

   To run with a microphone and speaker:

>>> da.loopDialog()


The program prints out a lot of debugging and diagnosis output to the screen.

7. In keyboard mode, read the program's output as "gen:..."

example:

gen: Would you like to send or receive a phone number?


8. Right now, the program is capable only of sending a telephone number to the user.
You can start by typing or saying,
"Tell me the telephone number"


9. To quit the program, 
-type "quit" at the keyboard

>>> quit

or if in mic/speaker mode,
-say "stop processing"
     "stop computer"
     "stop listening"
     "stop now"

To exit python, type
quit()


When you quit the running program, a transcript file, "transcript-da.text", is written to your home directory.
